# Check-the-weather

## Running Locally

1. Download nodejs version `14.17.4` from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and then restart your machine.

2. Clone the repository.

3. Open the `check-the-weather` repository in your selected IDE (VSCode preffered)

4. To start the server and client concurrently open a terminal window, type `npm run dev`. Otherwise you can start the server and client individually with `npm start server` and `npm start client`.

5. Most of the time you will want to go to `localhost:3000`, however if you are developing the API you will want to go to `localhost:3001`.
